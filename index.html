		<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Ika! I'm an Eevee who wears red glasses as their only defining character trait. That's it. 
			I don't really talk much, but I'd like to have more friends!
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm a programmer and I'm also technically a story writer. So far, I'm working on:
			<br />
			<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/17758141073/B0MBTASTIC-CLOSED">B0MBTASTIC</a> - A ROBLOX game inspired by <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/164051105/Super-Bomb-Survival">Super Bomb Survival.</a>
			Survive the bombs that rain from above for TIX!
			<br />
			<a href="https://github.com/Eeviika/Tomodach-ika">Tomogachika</a> <i style="font-size: 80%;">(its named tomodach-ika right now)</i> - A game where you take care of a little pet, or mod in your own! 
			<br />
			<a href="stories/eoa.html">Echoes of Another</a> - What would life be like if humans contained Pok√©mon like SCPs? Wouldn't end great, that's for sure.
			<br />
			<a href="#">QuickNotes 3.0</a> - My <i>first ever</i> programming project. Currently postponed indefinitely but will be put on GitHub soon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some more stuff about me:
			<br />
			My favorite games (or the top three at least) are PAYDAY 2, Team Fortress 2, and Terraria. 
			<br />
			<i>I also occassionally play Human Playground because I like being destructive :D</i>
			<br />
			My favorite color is <i style="color: blue;" title="I'm blue, da ba dee da ba dye">blue.</i>
			<br />
			I'm in the ol' United States of America. Land of the <i style="font-size: 50%;">"</i>free<i style="font-size: 50%;">"</i> and home of the <i style="font-size: 50%;">"</i>brave<i style="font-size: 50%;">"</i>!
